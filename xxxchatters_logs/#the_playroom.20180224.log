06[19:21] * ~melody` stretches on her bean bag
06[19:22] * MasterRenegade scrolls up thinking this is how melody started the festivities before but not being sure
[19:22] <RasputinX> She looks good as new
[19:22] <Stanley_the_Manly> A nice stretch does cause some stirrings

06[19:24] * +BustyLola giggles and stretches with melody` 
06[19:25] * Stanley_the_Manly sits back with a grin, taking in the sight of the stretching ladies 
[19:25] <@MrTLWolf> The girls were appreciating cocks bein' out, then they put those cocks in range of horny ladies, and away we went.
[19:25] <MasterRenegade> right but I think initially melody stretched first
[19:26] <~melody`> its possible!
[19:26] <RasputinX> A stretch is a good way to raise things
[19:26] <+cake> lol
[19:26] <~melody`> it actually started because tempest started groping BustyLily and BustyLola 's boobies, which led to cocks swinging around and then thrown in our faces :p
[19:27] <+BustyLola> in your face melody`, I just sat next to you after :P
[19:27] <@MrTLWolf> You needed cock bad too, didn't you, BustyLola?

[20:09] <+cherub> Is that supposed to scare me off Sirch?
06[20:10] * Sirch thinks for a moment, "Yes. Yes of course."
06[20:10] * Zsasz pinches cherubs butt
[20:10] <@MrTLWolf> That's not gonna happen.
[20:10] <Zsasz> Sneak attack 
[20:10] <@MrTLWolf> Unless it's /me sucks on Sirch's cock and deepthroats him til he cums all down his throat mmm yum thank you sir
[20:11] <Sirch> That would totally work on me. Shoulda lead with that. 
[20:11] <@MrTLWolf> One line scenes are the best
[20:12] <~melody`> :x
06[20:13] * @MrTLWolf grins at melody` 
[20:14] <@MrTLWolf> Can you imagine if every time we wanted to fuck in here it was just one line for the *entire* scene?
[20:14] <RasputinX> We'd get a lot more scenes done in the day that way
[20:14] <@MrTLWolf> Like, /me licks you and makes you cum then sticks his cock in and cums and gets you pregnant mm fuck yes
[20:14] <Sirch> It'd need to be at least two, otherwise it's just masturbation
[20:14] <@Shirley> Doesn't sound very enticing.
[20:15] <+moonglow> what abiut foreplay??
[20:15] <+moonglow> about*
[20:15] <Sirch> Oh I dunno, I masturbate all the time.
[20:15] <RasputinX> No time for that, moonglow
[20:15] <@MrTLWolf> Exactly, I'm just kidding
[20:15] <@MrTLWolf> But that's about what I have time for
06[20:16] * +moonglow pouts at no foreplay
[20:16] <~melody`> hehe, i don't mind reading one line scenes. i'm all about everyone enjoying themselves, no matter their 'skill' level in writing
[20:16] <@MrTLWolf> I don't mind one line responses, but I wouldn't want the whole thing boiled down to a single line
[20:17] <+cake> i don't like reading scenes that are like 5 lines
[20:17] <+cake> if i wanted to read a novel, I'd do just that
[20:17] <Zsasz> I like to leave room for response
[20:17] <+cake> same with writing 
[20:17] <@MrTLWolf> There are times where that gets hard to follow, as a reader and as a player in the scene
[20:17] <+cake> yeah. 
[20:18] <@MrTLWolf> If you can do it and keep it interesting, yeah, go for it.  But when I'm literally struggling to keep up with that much text on every entry, it's a wee bit of pressure
06[20:18] * +moonglow goes back to quietly sucking on the candy
06[20:18] * Sirch wonders who candy is.
[20:18] <+cake> i agree MrTLWolf :)
[20:18] <@MrTLWolf> Yay, we agree on something
06[20:18] * @MrTLWolf laughs
[20:19] <Zsasz> Sometimes you need words. Sometimes you don't. 
[20:19] <@MrTLWolf> Exactly.
[20:19] <Zsasz> The trick is to know which is which
[20:19] <@MrTLWolf> But I've scened with people who, like, require a paragraph every time, and it just got not fun
[20:19] <~melody`> yea, i agree cake. i would almost rather one line then seven.
[20:19] <~melody`> depending on the complexity of the scene, obviously
[20:20] <+cake> yeah
[20:20] <@MrTLWolf> Yeah, we were at two lines-ish, mel?  But it worked great.
[20:20] <+cake> it depends on my partner, really
