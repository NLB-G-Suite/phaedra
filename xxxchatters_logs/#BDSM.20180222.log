06[02:26] * RoughOne chuckles
[02:26] <Deckard> would work for action figures
[02:27] <@Aine> When I'm dealing with yarn barf it's practically shibari.
[02:27] <@Aine> Sheesh
[02:27] <@Aine> I moved an 8ft shelf so I could finally organize my craft stuff since the move.  Tired of it all being in bins.

[02:30] <@Aine> lol
[02:30] <RoughOne> nods
[02:30] <RoughOne> I hear you
03[02:30] * liltech is now known as DJ`liltech_prepping
[02:30] <@Aine> Right now I'm balling the rest of about 7 skeins of the same yarn into one ball.
[02:31] <RoughOne> ah
[02:32] <RoughOne> bought the mrs a tool for that
[02:32] <@Aine> Yeah, I need to get one.
[02:32] <RoughOne> now she wants all of the toiletpaper rolls for it
[02:32] <@Aine> lol
[02:32] <RoughOne> neat little device though
[02:32] <RoughOne> she has two: one I got from italy, actually
[02:33] <RoughOne> was from a person with the same last name as her.
[02:33] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`Shoo is playing 6 RM Info Promo - DJs Wanted!
[02:33] <RoughOne> seemed like a sign ;)
[02:33] <RoughOne> then the other is a ball making thing
[02:33] <@Aine> Neat!
[02:34] <@Aine> Yeah, I need the basic base for making cakes, a term I only recently became aware of.
[02:34] <@Aine> But they're center-pull which is what I like.
[02:35] <@Aine> I eventually need the giant spinner for hanks, though. 
[02:35] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`Shoo is playing 6 Skid Row - I Remember You
02[02:35] * SavageBeast (xxxchat@xchat-5B373ACC.dyn.optonline.net) Quit (Read error)
[02:36] <@Aine> Urg, this ball is getting hard to hold.  
[02:37] <RoughOne> yeah the one thing is an accordian spinner like thing
[02:37] <RoughOne> that's the old one from Italy
[02:37] <@Aine> Yeah.  Those are amazing for hanks.  Hanks are almost bigger assholes than skeins.
[02:37] <RoughOne> ah
[02:37] <RoughOne> dunno the terminology
[02:37] <@Aine> They look all neat and tidy.  Fucking shit to try to wind from without one of those.
[02:38] <RoughOne> ah
[02:38] <@Aine> Skeins are what you normally see at the store.  
[02:38] <@Aine> What most people call balls.
[02:38] <RoughOne> yeah she cranks them onto that then balls them with the other thing
[02:38] <@Aine> Hanks are those longer, twisted loops.
[02:38] <RoughOne> oh ok
[02:38] <RoughOne> seen them in stores, I think
[02:38] <RoughOne> oh yeah
[02:38] <@Aine> The nicer yarn shops, usually mom and pop places have tons of those.
[02:38] <@Aine> The big box stores, not so much.
[02:38] <RoughOne> they kinda look braided from the twist part, but arent
[02:38] <@Aine> They usually carry normal skeins.
[02:39] <RoughOne> there is a lovely yarn shop downtown
[02:39] <@Aine> The nicer yarn materials are usually hanked.
[02:39] <@Aine> Expensive AF though.
[02:39] <RoughOne> Two Knotty Ladies, I think it is called
[02:39] <@Aine> HA
[02:39] <@Aine> Love it
[02:39] <RoughOne> yeah :)
[02:39] <RoughOne> wife got their tee shirt LOL
[02:39] <@Aine> The dirty double entendres in the yarn world are awesome.
[02:40] <RoughOne> who knows, could be triple ;)
[02:40] <@Aine> Crocheters are Hookers.  (Crochet hook)

[02:42] <@Aine> -.-
[02:42] <@Aine> The end of this skein a 1 ft section just fell off.
[02:42] <RoughOne> ok, time to feed the pups
[02:42] <RoughOne> odd
06[02:43] * @shyNica snuggles on Deckard :p

03[03:02] * DJ`liltech_prepping is now known as DJ`liltech
[03:02] <RoughOne> bit of yarn there
[03:04] <@Aine> Yep, was about 7ish skeins of mill-end, didn't want them all floppy and all over the place.
[03:05] <RoughOne> so all the same dye lot?
[03:06] <RoughOne> how do you knit with that? just tie it onto the old thread when you run out of one?
[03:06] <@Aine> Yeah
[03:06] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`liltech is playing 6 Cinderella - Somebody Save Me
[03:06] <@Aine> When they start running out at the ends, don't have skeins that are up to normal weight, they toss it all into a bag and sell it.
[03:07] <RoughOne> oh oh, so these are the 'mill ends' and you balled them all up
[03:07] <RoughOne> never heard of that term before
[03:07] <@Aine> Yep.
[03:07] <RoughOne> where do you get that?
[03:07] <@Aine> You can get a good amount sometimes, for like $8 a bag.
[03:08] <@Aine> Joann's, sometimes Michael's too.
[03:08] <RoughOne> neat
[03:08] <RoughOne> now I think I see what you are doing
[03:08] <@Aine> I found mill ends of an awesome yarn one time.  In one of my fave colors.  It's getting turned into a blanket for the house.
[03:08] <RoughOne> I was thinking a ball of seven whole skeins of yarn
[03:08] <@Aine> Oh yeah, I made one ball.
[03:09] <@Aine> Tied the ends together and kept going.
[03:09] <RoughOne> blue made a hat one time when she was out
[03:09] <RoughOne> think she knit it ... may have crochets
[03:09] <RoughOne> yeah knit with chunky yarn I thnk
[03:09] <RoughOne> was huge.  When completely over her head like some variegated hood
[03:09] <RoughOne> then she shrunk it to a head model thing
[03:10] <RoughOne> made a nice hat
[03:10] <@Aine> LMAO
[03:10] <@Aine> I SUCK at sizing.
[03:10] <@Aine> So I don't do things like that.
[03:10] <@Aine> I don't have the patience.
[03:10] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`liltech is playing 6 Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb
[03:11] <RoughOne> blue is amazing at stuff
[03:11] <RoughOne> karen taught her tatting
[03:11] <RoughOne> she tats like a fiend now
[03:11] <RoughOne> like lace just rolls off her ahnds, I swear
[03:11] <@Aine> Oh man, I looooove the idea of tatting.
[03:12] <RoughOne> karen does needle tatting
[03:12] <RoughOne> well, they both do now 
[03:12] <@Aine> Don't know I could ever really do it aside from the occasional small thing for the hell of it.
[03:12] <RoughOne> she made some cute christmas ornaments 
[03:13] <RoughOne> little wreathes
[03:13] <@Aine> aw
[03:13] <RoughOne> starched
[03:13] <RoughOne> mount a pin on them and they make a cute seasonal brooch
[03:13] <@Aine> I've got some cotton.....I've tried doing tiny crochet....
[03:14] <@Aine> Eh.
[03:14] <RoughOne> think the mrs is doing a crocheted throw for an auction at a woman's shelter tea
[03:14] <@Aine> That's awesome.
[03:14] <RoughOne> my friend crochets at amazing speeds
[03:14] <RoughOne> does these VERY cute stuffed toys
[03:15] <RoughOne> she did a LEGO minifig one for me for christmas
[03:15] <RoughOne> and a bound nude woman too
[03:15] <RoughOne> with marks of lipstick LOL
[03:15] <@Aine> A friend of mind does those too, for how little patience she has for other things, I don't know how she has it for those.
[03:15] <RoughOne> hilarious
[03:15] <RoughOne> we told her she needs to have a table at the holiday craft fair here
[03:15] <RoughOne> do hand made toys for kids
[03:16] <RoughOne> ponies, polka dotted dinosaurs and such
[03:16] <@Aine> It's a tough market, honestly.  If you're just looking to get back the $$ put into supplies, people are willing to pay that.
[03:16] <RoughOne> she will do well with that I suspect
[03:16] <@Aine> It's hard to find people willing to pay for the time it took.
