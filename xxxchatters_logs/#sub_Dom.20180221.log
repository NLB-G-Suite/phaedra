[00:40] <+lutalica> yay!!!! good girl!!!
[00:41] <Darth> thats good
[00:41] <Lucky_Knyght> SlayerM: its a special kind of dom called dumbinant

03[00:42] * MindsEye (MindsEye@xchat-671CC56F.sub-174-255-5.myvzw.com) has joined #sub/Dom
[00:43] <+lutalica> a dumbinant would (to me) imply that he didn't know what he was doing, when clearly this person know what he was doing and chose to continue to do so.
[00:44] <SlayerM> if it happens once , its almost a certainty it will happen again ,thats been shown over & over again
[00:44] <+amie> 10he knew
[00:45] <+amie> 10he just thought i'd continue to let it slide.... like that's gonna happen
[00:45] <girl4bdsmrp> you can call them dumbinants, tumblrdoms, fakedoms, even abusers, but just don't push so hard that it seems like the scene isn't chock fulla them. 
[00:46] <+lutalica> i am proud of you for taking action against him amie, not many have the courage to do so.
02[00:46] * MindsEye (Look@inside.what.do.you.see) Quit (Quit: Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind" - Shakespeare)
[00:47] <SlayerM> unfortunately since D/s is somewhat more in the  open , you have dipshits that take advantage of under the guise of somination 
[00:47] <+lutalica> oh the scene is chaulk full of them sadly, hence why i weed them out from my local community. 
[00:47] <SlayerM> domination
[00:48] <girl4bdsmrp> the worst are when they're missing stairs.
[00:48] <+lutalica> here online. the fakes and posers will always be around sadly.
[00:48] <SlayerM> lol its a gathering place for them
[00:49] <+amie> 10thank you lutalica
[00:49] <+amie> 10and that's so true
[00:49] <girl4bdsmrp> anonymity adds another layer of bullshit for them to play with
[00:49] <+amie> 10It does
[00:50] <+lutalica> depends on where you go. 
[00:50] <+lutalica> i went to a party once
[00:50] <+amie> 10But he was RL
[00:50] <+lutalica> back in december
[00:50] <girl4bdsmrp> though... if you guys think that we subbies don't back channel to talk shit, you'd be wrong
[00:50] <+lutalica> was my second time going
[00:50] <+amie> 10lol girl4bdsmrp
[00:50] <+lutalica> everyone there was dressed normally.. etc.. except for one guy.. in full goth gear.. head to toe.. make up and all
[00:51] <+lutalica> he thought that he would be accepted as he was.. etc. 
[00:51] <+lutalica> he will never be allowed back at another party again. 
[00:51] <+lutalica> lol
[00:52] <+amie> 10lol
03[00:52] * +tara-tgirl (me@the.second.t.is.not.for.me) has left #sub/Dom
[00:52] <girl4bdsmrp> I've been that super out of place person
[00:52] <Darth> was there a dress code for the party ?  I dont see anything wrong if he was dressed differently.
[00:52] <girl4bdsmrp> kinda sucks
[00:55] <SlayerM> i have no use for goth  , but if it was only his appearance , those people have serious issues , this life is based on respect & acceprance of the didderences 
[00:56] <SlayerM> differences
[00:57] <girl4bdsmrp> what do you have use for?
[00:57] <SlayerM> pussy & ass
[00:59] <+lutalica> we have anominity in place for a reason, we dont stick out like sore thumbs on purpose.
[00:59] <girl4bdsmrp> guh, should have known
[00:59] <girl4bdsmrp> corny
[00:59] <SlayerM> ask a silly queation , thats what you get
[01:00] <+lutalica> what we do in the lifestyle can and does have a tendancy to stick out and draw attention of those around us who know about it. we dont need vanilla people poking there noses in and asking questions.
[01:01] <girl4bdsmrp> fine, I'll be more clear. You're dismissive of goth, so what's your style?
[01:01] <girl4bdsmrp> jesus
