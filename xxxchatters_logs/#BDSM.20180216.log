[06:26] <RoughOne> so more civil
[06:26] <johnp0107> hi
[06:26] <RoughOne> I would strongly urge you to get your EIT as soon as you can
[06:26] <RoughOne> so work under a PE
[06:26] <RoughOne> then get your PE as soon as you can after that
[06:27] <RoughOne> the EIT test is more difficult than the PE, so freshly out of school would be good, since it is a broader test
[06:27] <RoughOne> the PE exams are focused on your field
[06:28] <RoughOne> once you have a PE, you can call your shots in most private sector jobs though
[06:28] <hannah2> no, my goal remains environment but i would like to get a background and then go to law school and go environmental from there Sir with a construction background because construction is what confronts the environment in my opinion
