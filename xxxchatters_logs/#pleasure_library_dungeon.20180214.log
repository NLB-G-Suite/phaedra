[15:37] <Threeleggedcat> Hello lotte
[15:37] <+lotte> hi Threeleggedcat 
[15:37] <MindsEye> I see, however, it still reads as if you are going down a road of never being satisfied only to create greater longing by replicating that very feeling 
[15:38] <MindsEye> But alas, I am no PhD. 
[15:38] <Threeleggedcat> thats going on th assumption that one is never sattisfied in the first place
[15:39] <MindsEye> Then why else would you splice yourself to accomplish what you think needs to be simultaneously?
[15:39] <DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`Vu is playing 6 Judy Collins - Someday Soon
[15:39] <MindsEye> If you are satisfied, you are content with where and how you are
[15:40] <@Tw|sted> very true
[15:40] <MindsEye> If you are depressed you are living in the past. 
[15:40] <MindsEye> If you are anxious you are living in the future. 
[15:40] <MindsEye> If you are at peace you are living in the present
[15:40] <MindsEye> Wise words
[15:41] <Threeleggedcat> so, if one is satisfied, they should pass up any opportunity that makes things even better?
[15:41] <MindsEye> Define better
[15:41] <MindsEye> That is a presumptive quantum leap
[15:42] <MindsEye> Re read the quote I shared. 
[15:42] <DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`Vu is playing 6 RM Sponsor Channel Promo - #lust
[15:43] <Threeleggedcat> read it, doesn't change my stance, i would happily use technology to open different paths
[15:43] <@Tw|sted> if things are good then why stir the pot when all that could do is make them worse not better
[15:43] <MindsEye> The future will come to us regardless if we try to slam the gas pedal towards it or the brake in hopes of it not arriving.  Tell me, what mind is truly at peace in a multitude of directions?
[15:43] <Kay|eighJo> cause thats living
[15:43] <@Tw|sted> hugsssssssssssssssssss Kay|eighJo

[15:45] <MindsEye> That is fine Threeleggedcat because here is the secret. You’re not necessarily wrong and I am not necessarily correct in this equation. It’s opinion. 
[15:46] <@Tw|sted> and thats we call it a discussion
[15:46] <@Tw|sted> why
[15:46] <Threeleggedcat> well that is one thing we DO agree on MindsEye lol
[15:47] <Kay|eighJo> MindsEye i was a school pysch advisor for 23 years i know how to play the head games too .. however hopefully you learn from the past to make better choices in the future and why be content with "today" when there is so much life to live?
