[19:48] <@Aine> The strawberry butter came out great.  A bit tart, not too sweet.  I never really measure the sugar going into it, but I always go with less than recommended. lol
[19:48] <@Aine> Had it on a gently warmed egg bagel with a tiny bit of kerry gold salted butter.
[19:50] <RoughOne> oh awesome
[19:50] <RoughOne> good butter is the bestest butter ;)

[19:52] <RoughOne> had a basil herb one that was to die for
[19:52] <RoughOne> yeah we have an awesome bakery here, but they don't make bagels
[19:52] <@Aine> While I wasn't living here, they put in a drive through. :D
[19:52] <RoughOne> but their bread ... yum.
[19:52] <RoughOne> evil bakers

[19:54] <RoughOne> haven't found a place that has the variety they did then
[19:54] <@Aine> Yeah, I don't really go there much anymore.  The occasional coffee when I'm jonesing for a throwback.
[19:54] <RoughOne> yeah, exactly
[19:55] <@Aine> Yeah, they haven't done on-site baking in years.
[19:55] <@Aine> Sucks.
