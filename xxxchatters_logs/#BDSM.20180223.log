[15:32] <@Aine> Basic Rules: This is mainly a discussion room, not a play room. Don't be a dick. Don't advertize, don't troll. We do not have a rule against pming, but we discourage harassment both in room and in pm. If someone says to leave them alone, leave them alone. No link posting without permission from an op. No required protocols. Common courtesy and respect go far.
