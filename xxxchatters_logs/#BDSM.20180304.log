[04:32] <RoughOne> hello slavegrl_jodi 
[04:33] <+slavegrl_jodi> hello RoughOne Sir
[04:33] <RoughOne> we hauled our potted plants from California to here, Aine
[04:33] <RoughOne> had to put down cribbing in the truck we rented and make one trip just for them.
[04:33] <RoughOne> expensive plants ;)
[04:34] <@Aine> Yeah, we brought a few things up from SC, have them at my parents' house.  Not sure they're going to survive.
[04:34] <RoughOne> well, these were mostly for the pots.  We spent a small fortune on them right ebfore we left California
[04:34] <RoughOne> dunno if those plants will do well here
[04:34] <@Aine> Those suckers get SO expensive
[04:34] <RoughOne> yes!
[04:35] <RoughOne> we did a pool refurb and had this little strip between the decking and the fence
[04:35] <RoughOne> thoguht, wtf will we do with THIS
[04:35] <RoughOne> occurred to me that pots would work
[04:35] <RoughOne> so we got a few
[04:35] <RoughOne> small ones
[04:35] <RoughOne> and a couple of big ones
[04:35] <RoughOne> long story short the small were lost and the big ones ... well, they make BIGGER ones
[04:36] <@Aine> lol
[04:36] <RoughOne> 30" pots later POUS ... Pots of Unusual Size ...

[04:45] <RoughOne> but then, Im not pouring it down the sink
[04:45] <@Aine> Oh man, they finally got a hold of the GoFundMe for the family.  The goal was 3000, it's above that in three days.  The fire was Feb28.
[04:46] <RoughOne> oh wow
[04:46] <RoughOne> slow newsvine
[04:47] <@Aine> Yeah.
[04:47] <@Aine> As much as I hate to admit it, I double checked with the local news sources.
[04:47] <@Aine> I've seen scams like this on some of the Facebook pages before.
[04:49] <RoughOne> omg
[04:49] <RoughOne> seriously??
[04:50] <RoughOne> I don;t support things without knowing someone personally involved
[04:50] <RoughOne> guess if you didn't check.  Sad to know there are those that would do that
[04:50] <@Aine> Not usually in the Navy groups, thankfully... but yes.
[04:50] <@Aine> At least there's more believability for me if it's among the Navy groups.
[04:50] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`Mercury is playing 6 Rammstein - Engel

[04:52] <@Aine> It's timely, I had some stuff to run to donation anyway, so at least I know this stuff is going to someone for free, and I know it's going to someone specific.
