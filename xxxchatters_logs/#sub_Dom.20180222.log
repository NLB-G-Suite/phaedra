[03:31] <+lutalica> thanks amie
[03:31] <+lutalica> hello Thorn
[03:32] <Alexander> Seems weird to call someone you don't know by an honorific.
[03:32] <+lutalica> sometimes its viewed as a respect thing. *shrugs*
[03:32] <~Thorn> some of the subs enjoy it Alexander
06[03:33] * +amie nods

[03:34] <~Thorn> How do you figure Alexander ?
[03:34] <Alexander> I mean.
[03:35] <Alexander> What if someone doesn't like it when randomly people call them by honorifics?
[03:35] <+lutalica> then thats there choice and they have the right to tell the person that Alexander.
[03:35] <~Thorn> they generally politely as for them to not be used
[03:36] <Alexander> Seems simpler to just not assume in the first place.
[03:36] <Alexander> But I guess I have to consider the environment.
[03:36] <~Thorn> exactly Alexander
[03:36] <Alexander> Though that's a whole other soapbox.
06[03:37] * +lutalica smiles
[03:37] <+lutalica> though for me, online is different the real time.
[03:37] <+lutalica> *then
[03:37] <+lutalica> there are a lot of wanna be Ubar Domly Doms online.
[03:38] <+lutalica> that expect to be called Sir, Master, Lord, whatever they think makes them special.
[03:38] <~Thorn> on special occasions I prefer to be called Creator
06[03:38] * +lutalica rolls her eyes
[03:39] <~Thorn> well I am the creator of this room 
[03:39] <+lutalica> indeed Thorn, however, we are speaking of D/s here. not in room creations.
[03:39] <~Thorn> I hold myself to a high standard
[03:40] <~Thorn> on a hogher plane
[03:40] <Alexander> IRC is full of people that crave to have their egos stroked, and it's so very tired and transparent.
[03:40] <Alexander> But I won't bother getting into it.
[03:40] <~Thorn> I am the most shallow person that you'll ever meet on the web
[03:40] <+lutalica> i agree Alexander, its why i prefer my local community to online anymore.
[03:41] <~Thorn> where is your local community lutalica ?
[03:41] <+lutalica> i personally dont even call those in my local kink community 'Sir', unless if i know them well enough to play with them, or allow them to get that close.
06[03:42] * +amie doesn't have an ego
[03:42] <+lutalica> there are quite a few in the area Sir, however, the one i prefer, is in Houston.
