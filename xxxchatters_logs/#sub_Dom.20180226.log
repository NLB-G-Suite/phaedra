[09:00] <Pinky> You'll know/if when to initiate, if your close and she's smiling

[09:04] <dribbles> Haha I think so
[09:04] <dribbles> I'm bad with women
[09:05] <dribbles> I always get the date because I look good

[09:06] <Wolf-in-the-alley> I swear I can feel my intellect shrinking
[09:06] <Pinky> rofl
[09:06] <dribbles> Im kinda scared of sex
[09:06] <Pinky> have some rum
[09:06] <Wolf-in-the-alley> Along with my will to stick around
[09:07] <dribbles> Because I feel like she'll think Im a perve afterward
[09:07] <Pinky> And dont be afraid of sex... go with the flow
[09:07] <dribbles> lol
[09:07] <Pinky> Care.
[09:07] <dribbles> it makes no sense I know
[09:07] <Pinky> And you will find goodness.
[09:07] <Wolf-in-the-alley> That work for you dribbles? The whole virgin boy thing?
[09:07] <quaestio`> Goodness?
[09:07] <quaestio`> LMAO
[09:07] <Pinky> virgin boy thing?
[09:07] <dribbles> I am being completely dead set honest
[09:07] <dribbles> I'm 24 and a virgin
[09:07] <Wolf-in-the-alley> Well don’t feel too bad
[09:07] <Pinky> and yes, quaestio`, goodness. ;P
[09:07] <Wolf-in-the-alley> I got married at 24 and I was a virgin
[09:08] <dribbles> Im just terrified what a girl would think about me after sex
06[09:08] * quaestio` facepalms
[09:08] <Wolf-in-the-alley> But that was purely because I never found someone I wanted to fuck
[09:08] <Pinky> she'll either hold you and want more, or she wont...
[09:08] <quaestio`> Exactly
[09:08] <dribbles> Lol
[09:08] <quaestio`> It's not a big deal
[09:08] <Pinky> no need to fear it, though I certainly understand it.
[09:08] <dribbles> I;m big on morals
[09:08] <dribbles> was raised that way
[09:08] <Wolf-in-the-alley> Nothing wrong with that
[09:08] <Pinky> Well... smile... ensure she wants more, and then do the deed, mang.
[09:09] <dribbles> So, yeah, tonight I wanna do it, but I also dont
[09:09] <Pinky> An important step
[09:09] <Wolf-in-the-alley> Don’t rush it
06[09:09] * quaestio` giggles
[09:09] <Pinky> You may have a kid as a result, after all.
[09:09] <dribbles> I havnt rushed it
[09:09] <Pinky> Worst/best case
[09:09] <dribbles> its been 24 years
[09:09] <dribbles> taken it really slow
[09:09] <Wolf-in-the-alley> I mean if you hook up tonight
[09:09] <Wolf-in-the-alley> Don’t rush it
[09:09] <dribbles> sometimes I think maybe I should stick to jerking off
[09:10] <Pinky> Need more chaser for Me rum... :P -poofs-
[09:10] <dribbles> saves having sex with another person and the guilt
[09:10] <Wolf-in-the-alley> Foreplay is the key once you’re in
[09:10] <Pinky> Well...
[09:10] <Pinky> having sex with a random is normally a no no.
[09:10] <Pinky> its stupid..
[09:10] <Pinky> its dangerous, but...
[09:10] <Wolf-in-the-alley> Go down on her for hours - communicate well make sure you’re doing what she likes
[09:10] <Wolf-in-the-alley> How she likes
[09:10] <Pinky> shit happens... if you feel the time may be right... go for it.
[09:10] <Pinky> -poofs-
[09:10] <dribbles> I just dno..
[09:10] <dribbles> if it is out not
[09:11] <dribbles> what is considered losing virginity?
[09:11] <dribbles> oral?
[09:11] <Wolf-in-the-alley> Technically? Even a handy would count
[09:11] <dribbles> really?
[09:11] <dribbles> im just afraid of regretting it
[09:12] <quaestio`> Why would you regret it?
[09:12] <Wolf-in-the-alley> Well like I said I waited till I found someone I wanted to fuck
[09:12] <dribbles> Im not innocent anymore I guess
[09:12] <quaestio`> Sheesh!
[09:12] <Wolf-in-the-alley> Wasn’t going to just have sex for the sake of it
[09:12] <quaestio`> You are not innocent.
[09:13] <quaestio`> If you were, you wouldn't be here.
[09:13] <dribbles> but im only chatting lol
[09:13] <Wolf-in-the-alley> Hahah
[09:13] <Wolf-in-the-alley> quaestio` doesn’t this remind you of a conversation we had?
