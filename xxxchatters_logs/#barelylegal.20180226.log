[05:05] <Nick`3> I gave blood for a boy who had leukemia once 
[05:05] <notyourskittlez> Oh i'm sorry to hear that...i've heard graft vs host can be nasty :(

[05:07] <Nick`3> I dont know if they could pay me enough to give plasmia tho that just drains you lol
[05:07] <notyourskittlez> eh may as well just give whole blood. 
[05:07] <notyourskittlez> then they just spin the plasma out anyways.
