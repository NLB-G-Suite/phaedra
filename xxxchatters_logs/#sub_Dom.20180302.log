[04:10] <+trinket> it has to suck
[04:10] <NekoYuki> I go from brown to blue.
[04:10] <NekoYuki> Some men prefer dresses, without it reflecting or impacting sexuality/masculinity.
[04:10] <NekoYuki> I do see what you mean.
[04:11] <NekoYuki> I like my khakis and long sleeves, I’m fairly consistent.
[04:11] <+trinket> you and i can be slutty one moment and demure the next and something else wild the next day guys just cant get away with it

[04:35] <+lutalica> only thing you can do trinket. 
[04:35] <+trinket> art history can be a pain in the ass study they make you study pottery and architecture and try to force you to interested in all forms lol
[04:35] <NekoYuki> Especially tidbits like horror film being greatly effected by Vietnam.
[04:35] <+trinket> and i get it but it can be irritating
[04:36] <+trinket> i havent run into that one yet
[04:37] <NekoYuki> Vietnam war was being covered by news stations. The public got exposed to very strong imagery.
[04:37] <+trinket> and frankly i dont consider horror films art ya get a bunch of monster chasing stupid people and tell the people to do the dumbest thing possible
[04:37] <+trinket> dont run away go look in the casket
[04:37] <NekoYuki> Veterans coming from vietnam began to help make props in movies.
