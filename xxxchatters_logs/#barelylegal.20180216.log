[00:07] <+WolvenHeart> funny thing is when I was a DJ in college I had terrible 'mic fright' which I haven't had with the headset and mic cause I cant see the mic - I'm hoping that doesn't recur with the new stuff. we'll see! 
[00:08] <WH{viXXXen}> you afraid of wanting to do a bj to it?
[00:08] <+WolvenHeart> course in college you don't see the audience and sit in a fishbowl/studio with everyone watching you. that might have had something to do with it.
