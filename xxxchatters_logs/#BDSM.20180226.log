06[15:05] * Varick sees it is quiet but throws out the question anyway.
[15:05] <Varick> What is the prevalence of strap-on usage in the lesbian community?
06[15:06] * @Aine shrugs.
[15:06] <@Aine> Would have to ask amongst a large group of lesbians.
[15:06] <Varick> Yeah, that was my idea... but I'm not allowed in #Lesbian
06[15:06] * Varick chuckles
[15:06] <+shyboy> lol
[15:06] <@Aine> Happens.
[15:06] <Varick> Not that it is a large crowd in there.
[15:07] <Varick> Guess I'll have to go to a lesbian rally or something
[15:08] <@Aine> Probably not the best thing to ask at a rally.
03[15:09] * AndroUser2 (androirc@xchat-E1047C12.customer.lyse.net) has joined #BDSM
[15:09] <Varick> hmmm.. maybe the general chat room then.
[15:10] <@Aine> Some might think you're just looking for fap material or something, so it's probably not a question that is often taken seriously.
[15:10] <@Aine> Trouble with your connection, biboysub35no?
[15:10] <Varick> Probably.  Which explains lack of responses when posted in big chat rooms.
[15:11] <@Aine> It's a personal question.  No one is obligated to answer based on that alone.
[15:11] <Varick> Of course.
[15:11] <@Aine> It can feel like the lesbians are being seen as just an amusing curiosity.
[15:11] <@Aine> It's offensive at times.
[15:11] <Varick> Just because I desire knowledge, doesn't mean folks are obligied to give it.
[15:12] <Varick> Just googled fap.... funny
