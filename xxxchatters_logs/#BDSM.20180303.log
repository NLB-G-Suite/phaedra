[03:44] <RoughOne> how goes it?
[03:44] <@Aine> Not bad.  Waiting to see if this wind storm dies out.
[03:44] <RoughOne> ah
[03:45] <@Aine> Had a lovely coffee porter from Seattle, now an imperial cream ale 
[03:45] <RoughOne> oh nice
[03:45] <RoughOne> oh that cream ale sounds tasty
[03:45] <@Aine> It has some coffee, a creamy latte with caramel.  Smooth, the caramel comes in at the back end.
[03:46] <@Aine> Not too sweet.
[03:46] <RoughOne> interesting
[03:46] <RoughOne> what brewery?
[03:46] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`Shoo is playing 6 Texas Hippie Coalition - Turn It Up
[03:46] <@Aine> Due South, Boynton Beach, FL
[03:46] <RoughOne> cool

[03:49] <@Aine> Can says 8.2, but yeah
[03:49] <RoughOne> kewl
[03:49] <@Aine> Taking it a bit slow. lol
[03:49] <RoughOne> no sense of adventure ;)
[03:49] <@Aine> 16ozer
[03:49] <RoughOne> yeah ...
[03:49] <@Aine> Oh, I've lost timing on things like this and woof. lol
[03:50] <RoughOne> drank mine last night in three pours
[03:50] <@Aine> For the most part it sounds like the wind is dying down. 
[03:50] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`Shoo is playing 6 Rev Theory - Hell Yeah
[03:50] <RoughOne> oh good
[03:50] <@Aine> Growler?
[03:50] <RoughOne> no, bottle
[03:50] <RoughOne> forget how large
[03:50] <@Aine> Biggun?
[03:50] <RoughOne> 20?
[03:50] <RoughOne> yeah
[03:50] <@Aine> Yeah, got a few of those sizes in today, too.
[03:51] <RoughOne> I got a growler of barrel aged cherry a couple of weeks back
[03:51] <@Aine> Oh man, that had to be interesting.
[03:51] <RoughOne> was good, but ... not what I wanted a gallon of
[03:51] <RoughOne> it was
[03:51] <@Aine> LOL
[03:51] <RoughOne> tad sour for my liking
[03:51] <@Aine> Yeah, we've learned which ones to just taste at the place around the corner from our house in SC, and which ones to get growlers of.
[03:52] <@Aine> I need to find a place like that around here that isn't ass-raping expensive.
[03:52] <RoughOne> draper brewing out of Roseburg here
[03:52] <RoughOne> don't see it on their tap list though
[03:53] <RoughOne> was getting near the end of it
[03:53] <RoughOne> was $20 lol
[03:53] <RoughOne> 128 oz at $20 I can afford
[03:53] <@Aine> Yeah
[03:53] <RoughOne> why I love my growler
[03:53] <@Aine> I'd say most of the growlers we got down there were about that average.
[03:53] <RoughOne> check out growlerwerks dot com
[03:53] <@Aine> Looooove that place
[03:54] <RoughOne> wife got me a copper one for xmas
[03:54] <RoughOne> :)
[03:54] <@Aine> When we move back down, we want to do more brewing.  Maybe get a couple half kegs.

[03:56] <RoughOne> so an imperial stout in Cab Sav barrels with hand picked bing/lapin cherries from a local farm
[03:56] <RoughOne> a year in the barrel
[03:56] <@Aine> Woooo
[03:56] <@Aine> I like tasting the sours, but not drinking them.  They're really more made for small doses.
[03:56] <@Aine> For me, at least.
[03:57] <RoughOne> or perhaps ... a Belgian golden strong ale in cab sav barrels with new haven peaches ;)
[03:57] <@Aine> Oh hey
[03:57] <RoughOne> lambic-esque
[03:57] <@Aine> I have to admit, I haven't had any aged in wine barrels that I was all that impressed by.
[03:58] <@Aine> Not that I've had many.
[03:58] <RoughOne> I think that was the tartness I did not care for in that stout
[03:58] <RoughOne> now a lambic ...
[03:58] <RoughOne> that would be quite different than the stout

[04:03] <RoughOne> just a light beer, that ;)
[04:03] <RoughOne> yeah sour work well with some foods, but not to just drink imo
[04:04] <@Aine> Ok, question on the Scottish Ales....
[04:04] <@Aine> Are they all smokey AF in flavor or no?
[04:05] <@Aine> Just the bastard one I got, and just didn't notice when I bought it?
[04:05] <RoughOne> not had a smokey one
[04:05] <@Aine> I took one sip and had to dump it.
[04:05] <RoughOne> just a full mouthed lovely ale some years back
[04:05] <RoughOne> oh wow
[04:05] <RoughOne> that's a pity
[04:05] <@Aine> Yeah, I just couldn't choke it down.
[04:06] <RoughOne> had an amazing one some years ago at my bbq place that was to die for
[04:06] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`Shoo is playing 6 Hellyeah - Hell Of A Time

[04:06] <@Aine> Leave it in the bogs where it belongs.
[04:06] <@Aine> There is so much history that's being destroyed for using peat for fuel.
[04:07] <RoughOne> yeah, cheap fuel though
[04:07] <RoughOne> all people had for ages
[04:07] <@Aine> Yeah, but they're quickly running out of it.
[04:07] <RoughOne> yup
[04:08] <@Aine> And that was 10 years go we went to Ireland and was told about how quickly it's disappearing.
