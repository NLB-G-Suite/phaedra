[01:12] <@Aine> Basic Rules: This is mainly a discussion room, not a play room. Don't be a dick. Don't advertize, don't troll. We do not have a rule against pming, but we discourage harassment both in room and in pm. If someone says to leave them alone, leave them alone. No link posting without permission from an op. No required protocols. Common courtesy and respect go far.

[15:45] <wnt> im on this forum/website and i would like to have some play partners, but everybody seems to be so exp and i dont know what should I ask or how to start a conversation
[15:46] <@Aine> Play partners.... as in in person, or cyber?
[15:46] <wnt> are there any "rules" , idk
[15:46] <wnt> as in person
[15:47] <@Aine> Well, first suggestion is getting involved in your local community.
[15:47] <wnt> well this is a local community :)
[15:47] <@Aine> Getting to know people that way, and letting them get to know you tends to be a lot more successful than just randomly contacting strangers.
[15:47] <@Aine> So, you have to get out and go to their events.  Make some friends.
[15:48] <@Aine> Don't touch what isn't yours, person or toy.
[15:48] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`WolvenHeart is playing 6 Hugh Laurie - Buddy Bolden's Blues
[15:48] <@Aine> Common sense goes a long way.  Ask the people there whether or not anyone's looking for casual play partners, after you've gotten to know people first.

[15:49] <wnt> yeah, thats the problem, I dont want to go alone to this events, it is a little bit weird
[15:50] <@Aine> It's actually not weird.
[15:50] <@Aine> Not to the people there.
[15:50] <@Aine> How do you think other people started going. :D
[15:50] <wnt> yeah, i guess you're right
[15:51] <@Aine> Are you male or female?
[15:51] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`WolvenHeart is playing 6 Johnny Cash - Personal Jesus
[15:51] <wnt> but you know the feeling when you're just curious
[15:52] <wnt> M
[15:52] <@Aine> I absolutely do know the feeling.
[15:52] <@Aine> I've also gone to many a munch by myself, because my husband (while he's kinky with me) isn't interested in attending those most of the time, or can't.
[15:53] <@Aine> Big thing:  Don't treat it like a meat market.  Don't just hit on people willy nilly.  
[15:53] <@Aine> Seriously, focus on making friends.
[15:53] <@Aine> That'll be the biggest way to make the best impression.

[15:56] <@Aine> Lots tend to be unintentionally creepy. lol
[15:56] <@shyNica> Mhm
[15:56] <wnt> what do you mean by creepy
[15:57] <wnt> :))
[15:57] <@Aine> Don't oogle, don't stare too long, don't hit on people, don't pull yer pud at a play party... things like that.
[15:57] <@shyNica> Trying like... to force conversation the way you want it do go
[15:57] <@shyNica> Just work off other people's energy and follow the flow
[15:57] <@Aine> Don't be all talking about sex and kink right out the gate.
[15:57] <DJ`WolvenHeart> Hi all! Real life's dealt me a curve ball this morning, so I'm going to be playing some blues and other good stuff but I won't be taking any requests. Johnny Cash, RL Burnside, and more great blues, country blues and blues rock! Keep it locked in and loud!
