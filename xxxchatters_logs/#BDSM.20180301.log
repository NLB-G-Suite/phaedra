[01:13] <Lionheart166> so I have a question for any who want to answer 
[01:13] <RoughOne> sure
[01:13] <@Aine> Shoot.
[01:13] <Lionheart166> has anyone done(or have done to them ) forced orgams
[01:13] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`Shoo is playing 6 RM Sponsor Channel Promo - #Vamps`Cafe
[01:13] <@Aine> Personally, no.
[01:13] <RoughOne> I do forced orgasm play on my two primary partners often
[01:14] <RoughOne> they are female
[01:14] <Lionheart166> so is there a favoret meathed you use 
[01:15] <RoughOne> finger fucking and an eroscillator vibe
[01:15] <RoughOne> need bondage though.  They get overstimulated and moved around a lot
[01:16] <RoughOne> hydration is also important if they squirt
[01:16] <Lionheart166> I thought that was how it waas done restraing then stimulat until they orgams
[01:17] <RoughOne> well, you need restraint is what I'm saying
[01:17] <RoughOne> sling works best ime
[01:18] <Lionheart166> I see thank you RoughOne
[01:19] <RoughOne> anytime :)
[01:19] <Lionheart166> Has anyone forced orgamsed a guy
[01:20] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`Shoo is playing 6 Kiss - Detroit Rock City
[01:20] <RoughOne> no, but I suspect that would involve the prostate rather than the cock proper
[01:21] <@Aine> I haven't.

[01:23] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`Shoo is playing 6 Guns N' Roses - Paradise City

[01:26] <RoughOne> wonder if handsfree is into estim
[01:26] <RoughOne> that works for that
[01:28] <@Aine> Lots of people park and rarely talk.
[01:29] <Lionheart166> I see that 
[01:30] <Lionheart166> Aine just taking a guess here with the name but are you a Mistress 
[01:31] <@Aine> I'm female and dominant.  I don't prefer that particular term.
[01:31] <+DJ`Mercury> 14 Radio Meltdown: DJ`Shoo is playing 6 AC/DC - Sin City
[01:31] <Lionheart166> I am sorry I am still a bit new at this 
[01:31] <RoughOne> no worries, Lionheart166 
[01:31] <RoughOne> we were all new once too :)
[01:32] <@Aine> You couldn't have known.
[01:32] <@Aine> But indeed, not all dominant women like the term mistress for various reasons.
[01:33] <RoughOne> best to ask folks how they want to be addressed
[01:33] <Lionheart166> if I may ask how do you wish to be adressed 
[01:34] <@Aine> I prefer my name.
[01:34] <Lionheart166> I understand Aine
